/**
 * Method that can be used in testing environments to use a mock connection for the entire test

 *
 * Usage is straightforward: each test must declare the database queries that it expects to be
 * executed, and has a choice of mocking the result or ignoring it, which will yield a null result.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * describe('MyTestSuite', () => {
 *   const mockConnection = useMockConnection();
 *   it('is supposed to store a new PokÃ©mon in the database', async () => {
 *     mockConnection.expect('insertInto', (query, params) => 42);
 *     await db.insertInto(...);
 *   });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * It is not allowed for queries to execute during a test which were not declared, nor is it allowed
 * to declare queries that are expected to execute which then do not execute. Both will cause the
 * test to fail.
